# nokkud

`nokkud` is the Nokku daemon for your servers. It runs its own small SSH server on port 4022, next to your normal `sshd`. It checks Nokku certificates, keeps the list of who may log in up to date and renews the host certificate.

- **No proxy in the path.** Every server serves its own SSH connections.
- **Works when the core is down.** Logins are checked against the last synced access list.
- **Your `sshd` stays yours.** It is never touched and stays on port 22 as your way back in.

`nokkud` is one of three parts. [`nokku`](https://github.com/nokku-sh/nokku) is the core that decides who may log in where. [`nk`](https://github.com/nokku-sh/nk) is the CLI on your own machine.

## Quick start

Install it. The installer also sets up the systemd or OpenRC service:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.nokku.sh/nokkud | sudo sh
```

Create an enrollment token in the Nokku web app, under **Infrastructure, Daemons**. Then enroll the server and start the daemon:

```bash
sudo nokkud enroll
sudo systemctl restart nokkud
```

`nokkud enroll` asks for the token and does not echo it.

On a self-hosted core, point the daemon at it:

```bash
sudo nokkud --api https://nokku.example.com enroll
```

A core with a certificate from a private CA also needs `NOKKUD_API_PIN`. The enroll commands in the web app carry it. `nokkud` checks the core's CA against the pin once and keeps it with the enrollment.

The server shows up in the web app. Unless the token approves it automatically, someone has to approve it there before it serves logins.

## Network

Sessions reach the server in one of two ways, and `nk` tries both at once.

**Directly on port 4022.** This is the fastest path. Open the port for the networks your users connect from:

```bash
sudo ufw allow nokkud                                # Debian, Ubuntu
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nokkud   # Fedora, RHEL
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

On a cloud server, also allow TCP 4022 in the provider's firewall or security group.

**Through the relay.** The daemon keeps an outbound connection to the core, and sessions can travel over it. Nothing has to be opened, and the session stays encrypted end to end.

## Enrollment

- **Unattended installs:** set `NOKKUD_ENROLL_TOKEN` instead of answering the prompt. The token is never taken from the command line, where any local user could read it from the process list.
- **The service enrolls itself** on start when `NOKKUD_ENROLL_TOKEN` is set and nothing is enrolled yet. Once enrolled, the variable is ignored, so a token that stays in an environment file cannot move the server or spend another use.
- **Before enrollment** the service exits with a clear error, and systemd does not restart it.
- **Enrolling again** is safe. With a token from another workspace it moves the server there and drops everything the old one trusted.
- **A token can carry grants and tags.** Every server it enrolls starts with them. They are copied once, so changes made later in the web app stay.

Everything `nokkud` owns lives under `/var/lib/nokkud/`.

## Container

The image at `ghcr.io/nokku-sh/nokkud` is for devboxes, CI runners and sandboxes, anything you want to SSH into without opening a port. It enrolls itself on start and is reached through the relay:

```bash
docker run -d --hostname alice -e NOKKUD_ENROLL_TOKEN=... ghcr.io/nokku-sh/nokkud
ssh dev@alice
```

The image ships one login account, `dev`. Build on it with `FROM ghcr.io/nokku-sh/nokkud` to add your tools and users. The container has to run as root, which is the default.

- **Ephemeral tokens** are made for this. A container enrolled with one is approved right away, deletes itself when it stops, and is removed by the core once it has been offline for a while. A new container of the same name takes over from one that went away.
- **Names:** a hostname a person chose becomes the server's name in Nokku. A random Docker hostname gets a generated name instead, so pass `--hostname`.
- **A persistent devbox** mounts `/var/lib/nokkud` and keeps its hostname fixed. The identity is bound to the host, so a new hostname on an old volume fails to start.

## Install options

The installer adds the Cloudsmith repository and installs your distro's package (deb, rpm or apk). Other distros and pinned versions get the release tarball from GitHub. Pin a version with `--version <x.y.z>` or `NOKKUD_VERSION=<x.y.z>`.

Prefer to add the package repository yourself? The [package repository](https://broadcasts.cloudsmith.com/nokku/nokkud) has the apt, dnf and apk instructions.

<details>
<summary><b>Manual install from the tarball</b></summary>

Download the tarball for your architecture from [Releases](https://github.com/nokku-sh/nokkud/releases), then run the bundled installer:

```bash
tar -xzf nokkud_linux_amd64.tar.gz
sudo ./install.sh
```

Prefer to place things yourself? Copy [packaging/systemd/nokkud.service](packaging/systemd/nokkud.service) to `/etc/systemd/system/nokkud.service`, then register and start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now nokkud
```

On OpenRC or another init system, use [packaging/openrc/nokkud.openrc](packaging/openrc/nokkud.openrc) as a starting point.

## Configuration

| Flag            | Environment          | Purpose                                             |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--api`         | `NOKKUD_API_URL`     | Address of the core, `https` only                   |
| `--api-pin`     | `NOKKUD_API_PIN`     | Pin of the core's private CA, read at enroll        |
| `--ca-file`     | `NOKKUD_CA_FILE`     | PEM file with the core's private CA                 |
| `--ssh-addr`    | `NOKKUD_SSH_ADDR`    | Where the SSH server listens. Default `:4022`       |
| `--require-tpm` | `NOKKUD_REQUIRE_TPM` | Require a TPM 2.0 and refuse the software key       |
| `--debug`       | `NOKKUD_DEBUG`       | Debug logging                                       |

Session rules like recording and port forwarding are set in the web app, per daemon or as a workspace default.

## Operations

```bash
sudo systemctl status nokkud
sudo journalctl -u nokkud -f
```

When the core is unreachable, logins keep working from the last synced access list. Access changes and certificate renewals resume once the daemon reconnects.

A restart or a package upgrade ends the sessions that are open on the daemon.

## Uninstall

Reset the daemon first. This removes the server from Nokku and deletes all local state, so Nokku access to the server stops:

```bash
sudo nokkud reset
```

Then remove the package (`apt remove nokkud`, `dnf remove nokkud` or `apk del nokkud`). After a manual install, stop the service and remove the binary instead:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now nokkud
sudo rm -f /usr/bin/nokkud
```
